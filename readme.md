#SS13 Tools
Tools for working with the [tgstation/tgstation](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation) codebase and doing fun things.  

This is a refactor/rebuild of the original ss13 tools at [balohmatevz/SS13Tools](https://github.com/balohmatevz/SS13Tools)

##About
Importing [tgstation/tgstation](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation) as a `submodule`, this tool will turn Byond's DMI graphics files into separate PNGs. These PNGs are then overlaid on top of each other to form a complete mob sprite, which can then be used elsewhere.

**Caveat:** Generated image files are NOT saved on the server. You _must_download and re-host them elsewhere yourself. 

##WIP
This project is very much a work in progress. Expect things to not work.
